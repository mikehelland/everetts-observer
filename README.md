### Everett's Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics

#### overview: 

On page 9 of 1956's the _The Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics_[1],  Hugh Everett presents the requirements to be satisfied to say an observation has taken place in a mathematical model. After receiving his PhD, Everett went on to do more work with computers than theoretical physics. Though it would not have been remotely possible to implement in Everett's life time, his description of an observer in a mathematical model resembles a set of software requirements. This project explores ways to write an algorithm that satisfies those requirements and how such a model helps us understand measurement in physics, as well as what such a model quantitatively predicts.

#### I. Background

It is well known that when an object is measured in quantum mechanics, it changes. Hugh Everett goes further. He says when an object is measured in quantum mechanics, that the observer also changes, since the observer is a physical system having a physical interaction with another physical system:

>For this purpose it is necessary to formulate abstract models for observers that can be treated within the theory itself as physical systems, to consider isolated systems containing such model observers in interaction with other subsystems, **to deduce the changes that occur in an observer as a consequence of interaction with the surrounding subsystems**.
[1, p. 4]

What does this mean? It means that when you and I make a measurement, we gain a memory containing the outcome of that measurement. Is Everett actually suggesting that we make a model that contains a machine that makes measurements and records them in a memory? And that we look at the contents of an observer's memory to figure out how the model looks from the inside?

Yes, that's what he says alright:

>We have the task of making deductions about the appearance of phenomena to observers which are considered as purely physical systems and are treated within the theory. ...

>It will suffice for our purposes to consider the observers to possess memories (i.e., parts of a relatively permanent nature whose states are in correspondence with past experience of the observers). In order to make deductions about the past experience of an observer it is sufficient to **deduce the present contents of the memory as it appears within the mathematical model.**

>As models for observers we can, if we wish, consider **automatically functioning machines, possessing sensory apparatus and coupled to recording devices capable of registering past sensory data and machine configurations.**
[1, p. 9]

In the first and much longer version of his thesis, which was called _The Universal Wave Function_, he sums all this up:

>We shall be able to Introduce into the theory systems which represent observers. Such systems can be conceived as automatically functioning machines (servomechanisms) possessing recording devices (memory) and which are capable of responding to their environment. The behavior of these observers shall always be treated within the framework of wave mechanics. Furthermore, we shall deduce the probabilistic assertions of Process 1 as subjective appearances to such observers, thus placing the theory in correspondence with experience.
[2, p. 9]

This is actually a novel way of making predictions from a mathematical model. Rather than looking at the model from the outside, we try to find out how it looks from the inside. This isn't just a model of an object, but, in Everett's words, models a **"composite system: observer + object-system"**. We model the object we want to examine plus a physical observer to examine it. Then find out what the observer has learned. Put yet another way, this isn't simply a model of the things we measure, this is a model of measurement itself.
