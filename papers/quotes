Just as Einstein banished the ether as a medium for electromagnetism we must now complete his work by banishing spacetime as a medium for string theory. The result will be a model in which spacetime is recovered as a result of the relationship between interacting strings. - Gibbs

“It is utterly beyond our power to measure the changes of things by time. Quite the contrary, time is an abstraction at which we arrive through the changes of things.” 


In other words, there is a hierarchy of the real. The manifold world of our everyday experience is real with a relative reality that is, on its own level, unquestionable; but this relative reality has its being within and because of the absolute Reality, which, on account of the incommensurable otherness of its eternal nature, we can never hope to describe, even though it is possible for us to directly apprehend it.
